In C/C++ -> General, Additional Include Directories: C:\Program Files\Wt 4.1.0 msvs2019 x64\include
In C/C++ -> Preprocessor, ensure that WIN32 is defined. Also define HPDF_DLL, which will allow you to generate pdf files.
In Linker->General, Additional Library Directories: C:\Program Files\Wt 4.1.0 msvs2019 x64\lib
Go to Linker->Input. In the Additional Dependencies, fill out the Wt libraries you want to link to. At the topleft of the dialog, check the active Configuration. If it's Debug, link to wtd.lib, wthttpd.lib (and optionally wtdbod.lib, wtdbobackendXXXd.lib, ...). If it's release, link to wt.lib, wthttp.lib (and optionally wtdbo.lib, wtdbobackendXXX.lib). Notice that the debug libraries have a 'd' suffix. Be carefull. You need different libraries depending on the Release/Debug configuration, since it's not possible to mix different versions of the MSVC runtime libraries in one application.

If you want to run your fresh application, set these options:
In the Debugging tab, set Command Arguments to --docroot . --http-address 0.0.0.0 --http-port 8080
In the Debugging tab, set Environment to PATH=C:/Program Files/Wt 4.1.0 msvs2019 x64/bin
