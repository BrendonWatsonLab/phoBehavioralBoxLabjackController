As of right now, this is the fully functional piece of software that will run the Labjacks in the behavioral boxes.

Issues addressed:
	Analog signal continuous outputs from small changes
	Duplicate digital lines output

This has yet to be tested. Josh, Deniz, and I will most likely go in and manually test the functionalities.
